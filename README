The aim of this project is to build the Samsung Toolchain used in Samsung's Bada SDK under Linux

/!\ WARNING /!\
This is not an official Samsung project, we cannot guarantee any functionality, whatever you try is at your own risk.

Especially, we are not responsible for any bricked devices, your wife leaving you because of endless nights of compilation or the end of world.

This script is HEAVILY WIP (means: work in progress). So do not expect anything short of a miracle!

1. Prerequisites

You will need the sources for the toolchain. Samsung offers them on their opensource page. Check:

http://opensource.samsung.com/reception/reception_main.do?method=reception_search&searchValue=bada

and download the latest version to some folder. After download is complete, you will need to extract the contents.

Within the contents should be a folder named "samsung-sourceryg++-4.4-157-arm-samsung-nucleuseabi". It contains more zipped archives. Unzip all of them and copy the build_toolchain.sh script to this folder, since it will need the unpacked source directories for building.

Also, the script might need root, so its advised to add the user to the sudoers file.

In some cases, /bin/sh does not link to BASH but some other shell, please ensure that you are using BASH within this script

Additional development tools needed:

flex, bison, automake, autoconf, make, gnu toolchains, libtool, texinfo

2. Installation

Installation will be mostly automated by the build_toolchain.sh script. See the comments at the beginning for usage and configuration.

If you want to watch the process as well as log the outputs to a file, you could do:

./build_toolchain.sh 2>&1 | tee build_log.txt

or simply multitail on the logfile while its beeing generated.
